Mercury, the innermost planet of the solar system, is a little bigger than the Earth's Moon. The surface of the planet is covered with craters, like the Moon, but temperatures there can reach over 800Â°F because Mercury is so close to the Sun and rotates so slowly. This picture was taken by the MESSENGER spacecraft in October 2008.
