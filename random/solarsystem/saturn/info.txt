Have you ever seen the Southern or Northern Lights? Earth isn't the only planet that puts on these beautiful light shows, which are also called the "aurora". Aurora have been seen at both poles of Saturn, too, as well as at the poles of Jupiter. These "curtains of light" sometimes rise 1,200 miles (2,000 km) above the cloud tops near Saturn's poles. The Hubble Space Telescope took this picture in 2004.
