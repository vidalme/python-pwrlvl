The uniquely red global surface of Mars is marked by many interesting features - some like those on the Earth and others strangely different. The reddish color is caused by rust (iron oxide) in the soil. Some of these features are; volcanoes, canyon systems, river beds, cratered terrain, and dune fields. This image shows a global mosaic of 102 Viking 1 Orbiter images of Mars taken in February, 1980.
